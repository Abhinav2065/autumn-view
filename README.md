## Description
Autumn View is a front end website made using react. It is a really simple kinda website. It uses openstreetmap api as a framework for the mapping. It has detailed map of the world where there are multiple great spots. You can add spots near your home that you like as a location. 
You can add the Name of the Location along with a small description about the place. What to expect there and include some important info that might be required if a person goes to visit there. 
Then you can choose the amount of fall-ness? So you can choose this between Peak, so there is like maximum foliage and then There is Approaching Peak which is preety self explanatory imo. 
Then we have Past Peak. After filling the form for this you can choose your location on the map, so you can just click on the part of the map of your location so you can just zoom and move around the map and click on your location then you can click on "yes" on the top of the page to continue with Adding the location.
And then you can finalize the spot, so you will be given a popup that includes all the info that you gave and ask you if you want to add the location and if you choose to add it then a new location will be added on the map for everyone to see. 
You can cancle this process on any step, there are cancle button throughout this process.

Upon Adding the location It will show up on the map. If you click on the location and if you have your location acess given then you can see the distance between you and the place. (This is a direct distence between you and that place, this distance does not account for the distance of the road, its just the distance between the corrdinates of these two places)
You can see the name of the place, description about the pace put up by the person who added that location and then You can see the ratings of the place from previous reviewers. You can also add your own review on that by clicking on the golden "Rate" button and choosing the amount of stars out of five that you wnat to rate that place. Also if you know that the place is fake then you can report that place and you can see the amount of reports of that place as well.

Along with the markers for different places, there will also be a marker for your location, tho it might not be 100% accurate. I have seen it being about 2-3 km of range of my actual location.

You can zoom in and out of the map using mouse/touchpad or the zoom buttons on the top left corner of the map. You can move around the map using the arrow keys or mouse/touchpad. 

You can view the featured location on the Featured Page which you can acess from the navbar of the website. There is a button for Adding a location there as well which will take you the the popup of the Map page.

Then there is the About Page of the website, So this page has basically simple info about this project and how to use it. You can visit it using the navbar or '/about'
